    <h2>Biography:</h2>

 <p> I was born in montreal in 1995. I lived in the area for 7 years until
     I moved to missisauga with my mom and brother. After a couple years,
     we moved to Innisfil, Ontario, where I spent most of my formative years.
     I went to a French Catholic highschool where I met my best friends
     who i still keep in touch with daily, all thanks to modern techonology. (aka Discord and video games)
     After highschool, I did a semester of the electrical technician course but unfortunately dropped out as
     the dangers of it intimidated me. If I could go back, I would of kept with it as I would be
     much better off now financially. Although, they say forsight is 20/20.
<p>

 <p>After I dropped out, I worked at a factory for a few months and then did
     Stucco for homes for about a year. After that, I moved to Fort Mcmurray, Alberta, in search
     for a well-paying job. I was working in fast-food while I was
     waiting on a Union list. Before i was able to secure a good job,
     my girlfriend (at the time), my cat and I had to evacuate for 3 months
     due to the forest fires that ate a good part of the neighbourhoods surrounding
     the City. We fell inlove with Vancouver Island and lived
     in Nanaimo for a bit over a year's time. (sadly, I didnt try the Nanaimo bars) 
    </p> 
   
     <p> I moved back to Ontario and completed police foundations
     at Georgian College in Orillia. I then worked as a security guard
     at Georgian College for a year and a half. I realised that I did not
     want to pursue that career for several reasons and moved to Midland where
     I worked for Tay township and then the City of Midland in the Operations department.
     After seeing the success my friends were having in the tech industry,
     I decided to pursue an education in programming as I have always been
     passionate about computers and how they work. I've experienced many different
     fields of work such as Construction (siding, large-scale Framing), Kitchens, Customer service,
     city operations, landscaping, security, duct cleaning, and a few different types of factories. I am hoping that i find my place
     in the tech industry as it is a constantly evolving environement, contains problem solving,
     and is a part of almost everything we encounter today.

     <p> It honestly blows my mind everytime i think that all this techonology that we take for granted came from 
        ingenious men and women who put some metal and plastic together and told it to do things.
        I look forward to the many things you have to teach us this semester!!
